# ü©∫ API CLINIC üè•

## Description

In this project, I use Spring Boot to develop a RESTful API for a medical clinic called "Gomez Clinic." The API handles the management of doctors, patients, and appointments, utilizing JPA/Hibernate for database operations. This API includes advanced features such as data validation, JWT security, and a set of automated tests to ensure code quality, not to mention the documentation done in Spring Doc.
